                        Java (Indonesian: Jawa, Indonesian pronunciation: [ˈdʒawa]; Javanese: ꦗꦮ; Sundanese: ᮏᮝ)
                        is one of the islands of the Greater Sunda Islands in Indonesia,
                        bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and the Java Sea on the north.
                        With a population of 147.7 million (Java only) or 151.8 million (including the inhabitants of its surrounding islands,
                        principally Madura), Java constitutes 56.1 percent of the Indonesian population
                        and is the world's most-populous major island.[1] The Indonesian capital city, Jakarta, is on its northwestern coast.
                        Much of the well-known part of Indonesian history took place on Java.
                        It was the centre of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates,
                        and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. 
                        Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s.
                        Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically and culturally.
                        Four of Indonesia's eight UNESCO world heritage sites are located in Java: Ujung Kulon National Park,
                        Borobudur Temple, Prambanan Temple, and Sangiran Early Man Site.

                        Formed mostly as the result of volcanic eruptions from geologic subduction between the Sunda Plate and Australian Plate,
                        Java is the 13th largest island in the world and the fifth largest in Indonesia
                        by landmass at about 138,800 square kilometres (53,600 sq mi).
                        A chain of volcanic mountains forms an east–west spine along the island.
                        Four main languages are spoken on the island: Javanese, Sundanese, Madurese, and Betawi, 
                        where Javanese and Sundanese are the most spoken.[2] Only two ethnic groups are native to the island—
                        the Javanese in the central and eastern parts and Sundanese in the western. Most residents are bilingual,
                        speaking Indonesian (the official language of Indonesia) as their first or second language.
                        While the majority of the people of Java are Muslim, Java's population comprises people of diverse religious beliefs,
                        ethnicities, and cultures.[3]
                        Java is divided into four administrative provinces: Banten, West Java,
                        Central Java, and East Java, and two special regions, Jakarta and Yogyakarta.
